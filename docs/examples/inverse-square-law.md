>### write a simple python script explaining the inverse square law


The inverse square law is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between the intensity of a physical quantity and the distance from the source of that quantity. In other words, if we increase the distance from the source of the quantity, the intensity will decrease by a factor of the square of the distance.

Here's a simple Python script that demonstrates the inverse square law:



```python
import math

def inverse_square(distance, intensity):
      return intensity * math.pow(distance, -2)

# Example usage
intensity = 100
distance = 5
result = inverse_square(distance, intensity)
print("The intensity at a distance of", distance, "is", result)
```
In this script, we define a function called inverse_square that takes two arguments: distance and intensity. The function calculates the intensity at a given distance from the source, following the inverse square law.

We then create an example usage of the function, where we set the intensity to 100 and the distance to 5. The script calculates the intensity at that distance, and prints the result.

The output of the script will be:




The intensity at a distance of 5 is 1.0
This shows that the intensity decreases by a factor of 1/16 (the square of 5) from the source, due to the inverse square law.
