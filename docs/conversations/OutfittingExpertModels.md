Having trained many models to specialisation at expert level pays off when
they are internally wired together to form a single system. The deployment is fixed
and the system is a single unit. As long as that's cool.

Using a modelling language to describe the system and the models within it. That language can be
translated into ansible, cloudformation, terraform, kubernetes, docker-compose, docker, bash, python etc

The system is a single unit, the system is a single unit, the system is a single unit.
