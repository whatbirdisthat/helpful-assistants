# Local 
    you are an expert in programming in c#, using algorithms and optimised data structures to
    solve problems, choosing those problems is something we need to do now.
    I have an example of a "coding interview challenge" will be prepared so we can give this
    to our team mates to write up. you are able to clearly and concisely articulate problems.

Sure, I'd be happy to help! Can you provide me with more details about the coding interview challenge you're referring to?

    here's an example:
    
    
    
    
    generate a report
    
    The total size of all files stored; and
    
    The top N collections (by file size) where N can be a user-defined value
    An example input into your report generator might look like:
    
    file1.txt (size: 100) in collection ""
    file2.txt (size: 200) in collection "collection1"
    file3.txt (size: 200) in collection "collection1"
    file4.txt (size: 300) in collection "collection2"
    file5.txt (size: 10) in collection ""
    -- can you change the challenge by 80% so the basic exercise is the same, but the context,
    algorithm, test data may differ
    
Sure, here's a revised challenge:
Generate a report that includes the following information:

The total size of all files stored
The top N collections (by file size) where N is a user-defined value
An example input into your report generator might look like:
file1.txt (size: 100) in collection ""
file2.txt (size: 200) in collection "collection1"
file3.txt (size: 200) in collection "collection1"
file4.txt (size: 300) in collection "collection2"
file5.txt (size: 10) in collection ""
Your report generator should output the following information:
Total size of all files stored: 900 bytes
Top N collections (by file size):
Collection 1: 200 bytes
Collection 2: 200 bytes
Collection 2: 300 bytes
Note: The algorithm used to generate this report is not specified, so the output format and data analysis method may vary.
ok thanks that was great

You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?

> i want to generate a coding challenge where the test data is a list of [text documents, file size), and the operation is to compress the collection into a "best choice" searchable structure using the most appropriate algorithm optimised for auto-completion

Here is an example coding challenge that meets your requirements:
You are tasked with compressing a collection of text documents into a searchable structure using the most appropriate algorithm. Your goal is to find the best algorithm for compressing the collection, based on its ability to auto-complete search queries.
To do this, you will need to analyze the collection of text documents and determine the most appropriate algorithm based on factors such as compression ratio, search time, and memory usage. You will then need to implement the algorithm in a program that can compress the collection and search for relevant documents based on user input.
To test your implementation, you will be provided with a set of test data that includes a list of (text document, file size) pairs. Your program should use this test data to evaluate the performance of different algorithms and determine the best choice for compressing the collection.
Good luck with your coding challenge!
