"""
app.py
------
The UI for the application.
This is the only part that uses Gradio, which makes the code
less noisy, so I can follow what the code is doing more easily.
From here, we pass the values of the UI components into the
"engine" which uses python primitives.
@Communicator is the class that holds a method we pass to Gradio ChatInterface
and is the easily-swappable piece, so I can write test code that uses a fake
ChatGPT (@FakeCommunicator) and is completely deterministic - a controlled environment.
